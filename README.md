# Book Store

### Getting started

Make sure you have the [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli#installation) installed globally, then run `npm install` to resolve all dependencies (might take a minute).

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

### Building the project

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Functionality overview

This application creates a simple book store using [Google Books APIs](https://developers.google.com/books/docs/v1/using). Books can be searched by title.
